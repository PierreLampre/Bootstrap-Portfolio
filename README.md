# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This is the second half of the second assignment from Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp.

After adding media queries to our Basic Portfolio page, the class was tasked with building a similar portfolio page using Bootstrap.

In similar fashion, the site includes an About Me section, a Portfolio grid, and a Contact form.  The class was asked to use minimal CSS styling and focus on using Bootstrap classes for positioning and styling.

Please feel free to look over the code if you are working on a similar project.
